For viewing, Pauli decomposition can be used for quad-pol, or HH/HV and VV/VH for dual-pol images. Grayscale coherence correlation products can also highlight areas of change.

    "The overlay of the intensities of the different polarization channels, allows users to visually classify a scene by its backscattering mechanism, such as surface scattering (strong HH and VV return), volume scattering (strong HV return) and double-bounce scattering (strong HH return). Thus in RGB images, areas dominated by green (HV) intensity are typically vegetated areas. Areas dominated by shades of pink (HH+HV) intensity are typically inundated forests or vegetated fields. Black and dark grey areas are usually smooth surfaces (roads, open water, smooth bare ground) where there is very little radar backscatter.   \n",
